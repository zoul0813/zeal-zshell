# ZShell Interactive Demo

This is a preview of Zeal 8-bit OS with ZShell and coreutils preinstalled.

There are a number of apps, games, etc on T:/

Things to try:

`tree` - the tree command is new to coreutils
`setfont t:/sys/CAFE.f12` - setfont is new to coreutils, some fonts are available in T:/sys/
`zc` - Zeal Commander is a text-mode UI for browsing your system.
